## Summary
The game starts with a scene of our protagonist, Max, who comes home to find his brother playing with/destroying his toys. In a rage, Max decides to look up a spell to get rid of his annoying brother. By performing the spell he summons a monster through a portal that takes his brother. Immediately regretting this decision he go through the portal in an effort to rescue his brother and bring him back home. After some gameplay, Max eventually comes to a giant tree in a desert where he is informed, by our hero’s mentor, of Lord Mustacho who is trying to switch bodys with our brother in an attempt to become younger and stronger.
Max is given the ability to enchant any object that he has, to give him a fighting chance, and decides to use his magic marker. The first of the 5 abilities is the manipulation of earth; The others have to be collected throughout the rest of the world. In the end you have the united powers of: earth, branches, vines, water and fire. These abilities are picked up in the different regions you travel through: the desert, the jungle, the dark forest, the swamp and the volcano. After this you enter Lord Mustacho’s Lair to get your brother.
You can control you character with the typical analog direction joystick and can jump or crawl. You can use another control to pull out the magic marker and another control to use it. As you hover the magic marker over different locations on the screen the marker will glow a different color for the power that is allowed to be used there, or no color if the powers are not applicable. There are mini and full-sized monsters that you encounter( some of which change depending on the environment that you are) that you have to outsmart using the magic marker. You can also collect pieces of an amulet or destroy the spy eyes that Lord Mustacho has around to unlock other things in the games.


## Final Thoughts
This is one of my favorite games to play. I think that a lot of the scenery is beautiful and well made. I find that the majority of the game maintains a low stress atmosphere which is really great if you like to play games to relax. It primarily works as a game to exercise your mind with the series of puzzles you’re required to use to finish each of the levels. The controls aren’t exactly what I would have would have expected when I first played it but they are easy to get comfortable with. I enjoy that it does still provide a reason to keep playing the game after you've completed it. It also let's you play certain levels and just adds anything extra that you found without having to refind everything. It’s a simple game and story but it provides hours of fun.
